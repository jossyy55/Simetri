             Hello, I am Raiden Ei, the Electro Archon and ruler of Inazuma, 
             also known as the Shogun Raiden. As the guardian of eternity, I oversee Inazuma, ensuring the nation remains steadfast and unshaken by the changing world. My philosophy of eternity was once reflected in the Vision Hunt Decree I implemented, though I have come to realize that not everyone could understand the path I chose. </p>
          <p class="text-basetext-[4B5563]">s
              Although I may appear as a cold and unfeeling leader, I harbor a deep curiosity and admiration for humanity and how they cherish the fleeting moments of life. Through my journey with the Traveler, I have come to understand that true eternity is not stagnation but the ability to embrace change while preserving the essence of what is most valuable. As both a warrior and a seeker of lifeâ€™s meaning, I continue to strive for balance between my duties as an Archon and my soulâ€™s desires as Ei.</p>
